There are two types of programming assignments in this course: Programming
Quizzes (the directories named _quizNN_) and Projects (the directories named
_projectN_). Everything is written in C++. Wherever possible, I try to use
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) and avoid nonportable idiosyncrasies like
hardcoding directories.
